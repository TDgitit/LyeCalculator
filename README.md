# LyeCalculator
This is a lye calculator for soap-makers to compute the right amount of lye and liquid needed to make a perfect batch of soap.  This application also allows users to save their recipe for future use, and update the oil database as they come across new oils that they would like to use in their recipe.

This project is coded in Java using Eclipse, Swing framework, and SQLite database.


To use the application, copy both the .exe (or .jar) and .db files to the same directory on your computer and run the .exe (or .jar) file.
